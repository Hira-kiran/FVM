Flutter Version Management (FVM)


-> We use this for managing diffirent versions of flutter

-> For example, we have different projects and all projects have different SDK versions, then we dont need to install all of the versions manually.

we simply use FVM for version management.

Follow this also:  https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation

Firstly we need to install FVM
Run:  For Mac
brew install fvm

Then for checking all the version 
Run: fvm releases
It shows the List of versions 

then for install specific version
Run: fvm install version_number 
Like fvm instal 3.22.2


So, if we install 3 to 4 versions then for choose anyone 
Run: fvm use 2.22.2

For checking which versions is installed, then 
Run: fvm list
